        Part 1
    </h3>
<br><br>
    <p>
        Before the experiment started everyone drew an envelope which contained either a Yellow or a Blue slip.
        You have been assigned to the Blue group if you received a Blue slip, and the Yellow group if you received a Yellow slip.
        There are 3 people in each group.
        Your group assignment will remain the same throughout the experiment.
        That is, if you drew a Blue slip, you will be in the Blue group for the rest of the experiment, and if you drew a Yellow slip, you will be in the Yellow group for the rest of the experiment.

        Your group will compete against the other group in a task.
        The task is the following.
        In Part 1 everyone will be shown 5 pairs of paintings by two artists.
        You will have 5 minutes to study these paintings on your own.
        Then everyone will be asked to answer questions about two other paintings.
        We will calculate the total amount of correct answers for each group.
        The group whose members will have more correct answers will win, and each group member will earn a monetary reward of  XX€.
        The group that will have less correct answers will lose, and its members will receive no monetary reward.
        Whether your group had more or less correct answers than the other group will be disclosed at the end of this study.
