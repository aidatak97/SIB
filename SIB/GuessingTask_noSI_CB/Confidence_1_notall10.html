    <h3>
        Part 4
    </h3>
        <br>
        <br>

        Before proceeding with part 5, we will present you with two additional tasks.
        The tasks are connected to the previous task which you have just answered.
        In case part 4 is drawn for payment, you will receive a fixed additional sum of M euros for the first additional task.
        Moreover, you will also have a chance to earn additional money on the second additional task.
        This means that, if part 4 is chosen for payment, the earnings from both first and second additional task will be added to any earnings you might have made on the previous task (task in which you indicated the number of times senders have stated exactly what their assigned estimation device has stated).
        Once you answer on the first additional task, you will be presented with the second additional task.
