        Welcome to our study!
    </h3>
<br><br>
    <p>
        In the study, you will participate in 4 different parts.
        You will be able to earn additional money in parts 1 and 2.
        At the end of the study, one of those parts will be randomly chosen, and you will be paid according to your earnings in that part.
        Since you do not know in advance which part will be selected, you should treat each part as separate and pay attention in each part.
        At the beginning of each part, you will receive the corresponding instructions.

        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>When you are ready, please press “next” to start with the first part.</strong>
