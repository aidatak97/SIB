        Part 1
    </h3>
<br><br>
    <p>
        Before the experiment started everyone drew an envelope which contained either a Yellow or a Blue slip.
        You have been assigned to the Blue group if you received a Blue slip, and the Yellow group if you received a Yellow slip.
        There are 3 people in each group.
        Your group assignment will remain the same throughout the experiment.
        That is, if you drew a Blue slip, you will be in the Blue group for the rest of the experiment, and if you drew a Yellow slip, you will be in the Yellow group for the rest of the experiment.
        In Part 1 everyone will be shown 5 pairs of paintings by two artists.
        You will have 5 minutes to study these paintings on your own.
        Then everyone will be asked to answer questions about two other paintings.
        Correct answers are rewarded with 1 additional token that adds to your group account.
        The group who collects more tokens will win a monetary reward of XX€.
        The other group will receive no monetary reward.
        Whether your group achieved more or less points than the other group will be disclosed at the end of this study.
