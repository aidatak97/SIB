        The task is the following.
        In Part 1 everyone will be shown 5 pairs of paintings by two artists.
        You will have 5 minutes to study these paintings on your own.
        Then everyone will be asked to answer questions about two other paintings.
        We will calculate the total amount of correct answers for each participant.
        The participant who will have more correct answers will win, and will earn a monetary reward of  XX€.
        The other participants that will have less correct answers will lose, and will receive no monetary reward.
